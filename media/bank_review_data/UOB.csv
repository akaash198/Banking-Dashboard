Digital token is a digital security token embedded in your mobile device that replaces SMS-OTPs. The digital token PIN is needed when adding a payee, updating mobile number or making transactions above the pre-defined limit.

For scheduled UOB credit card payments, ""Statement due"" will be displayed. As your card statement changes monthly, you are right to check the statement or card details for the actual amount for any specific month. Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback on the scheduled transfer journey on PIB and UOB TMRW app.

The latest app version 14.2 runs on devices with OS 8.0 or higher.

We regularly update our app to protect our customers from evolving cyber security threats. Older Android OS tend to have security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by fraudsters and hence we'll need to increase the minimum Android OS supported.

Mighty Secure is embedded to your device, replacing SMS-OTPs & needed when adding a payee, updating mobile number or making transactions above pre-defined limits.

The UOB Mighty App only runs on devices OS 8.0 or higher.

We regularly update the app to protect our customers from evolving cyber security threats. Older Android OS tend to have security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by fraudsters, hence we need to increase the minimum Android OS supported.

We regularly update the app to protect our customers from evolving cyber security threats. Older Android OS tend to have security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by fraudsters, hence we need to increase the minimum Android OS supported.

On checking further, it appears that this app now runs on Android 6 and above.My phone's Android version cannot be updated further. This is creating much inconvenience for me (and numerous other users) as I cannot do mobile banking transactions. I believe this problem surfaced after a recent UOB Mighty app update. UOB cannot expect users to change our phone just to satisfy UOB. After all, all other UOB apps, even apps from other banks, and all other apps on  Google Play Store work fine on my phone.

We should be given option to choose between the old N this! I dwloaded the old version because I always have problem logging in from their website! Key in user name n password correctly but it wouldn't let me log in! The problem FINALLY resolved after I started using the old app. But now this app wouldn't let me log in again! Neither the web!

The same username and password is used to sign in to the old app, personal internet banking and UOB Mighty. We know you are using S6 and Android 5.1 but can you drop us a note at pfs.mobile@uobgroup.com indicating #1 so that we can contact you after investigation. 

Thanks for your feedback.
